# PC File Uploader

This is a simple Python script for transferring files from a PC or smartphone to another PC.

It turns your PC into a web server with file uploading functionality. You can access the server within the same WiFi network using any web browser on devices such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, or iOS. Upload the file you want to transfer to the PC.

## Usage

Use this command:

```bash
python uploader.py
```

If the server starts successfully, the running server's IP and port will be displayed in the command line.
